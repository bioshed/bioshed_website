<p align="justify">BioShed was born out of a common frustration for biotech labs around the world - bioinformatics and data scientists end up spending more than half of their time dealing with IT, infrastructure, software management, and data wrangling issues instead of focusing on bioinformatics and data analysis. The mission of BioShed is to take care of all of the infrastructure pain points, and provide both software and a compute environment that allows scientists to focus on their data.</p><br>
